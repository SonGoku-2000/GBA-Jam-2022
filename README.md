# GBA-Jam-2022

My first language isn't english
This is the fist time writing since the inscription to the jam

I'm trying to do a pirate adventure and don't know how to be the final game

October 16 

I don't update since october 10, because emotional problems but i'm back.

Refactor of the class Hitbox and Jugador

Create the class Enemigo and PirataMalo usin the same placeholder of the pirate but with diferent colors

I'm taking a little course of git and found that the titles for the commits for github should be more descriptive for other people that read the code and for me in the future, I will try to implement all that i learn in that course

Someone could ask why in the  include files i use .hpp instead of .h, and the reason is because in visual studio code the simbol that apears in the name of the file changes to a c++ simbol, instead of the c simbol of a .h file


October 10

Start creating a placeholder sprite for the pirate

Using some code frome feline the progres will be fast

I planing change some things that don't like from the feline code
